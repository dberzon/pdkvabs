pure data abstractions 

<b>bangsync.pd</b> - syncs up two bangs. <br>
<b>cospan~.pd</b> - equal-power cosine panner <br>
<b>phasevoc~.pd</b> - a phase vocoder abstraction lifted from Miller Puckette's I07.phase.vocoder.pd from the help files. Like tabread4~, hot signal inlet indexes by sample. First arg is array name, second is window size. <br>
<b>selector.pd</b> - a row of 32 toggle boxes whose values are stored in an array (name passed by argument, requires cyclone) <br>
<b>stutter~.pd </b>- a delay-based stutter effect <br>
<b>syncloop.pd</b> - a synchronized looper, requires bangsync. <br>
<b>oneShotM.pd</b> - a one-shot sample player, left inlet takes a bang to trigger playback, right inlet takes a path for file. <br>
<b>oneShotS.pd</b> - stereo version <br>
<b>tri~.pd</b> - nonbandlimited triangle oscillator based off Miller Puckette's  J05.triangle.pd<br>
