- dkrunmax - running maximum
- dkrunmin - running minimum
- dkrgate - let through anything x% of the time
- dkscaledeg_van - borrowed from SuperCollider's Scale object. Maps scale degrees to midi notes. Arguments are scale and starting midi note. Vanilla version of my scaledeg external using tables

- dkseqgen1 - timed random sequence generator
- dksmp2ms - samples to ms
- dkstpan~ - stereo panning 
- dkstrippoly - a poly without noteoff messages (or zero velocity notes)
